Eliot Glairon's Website
=======================

This is my personal website, detailing my portfolio and some of my previous work.  It is currently hosted on www.eliotglairon.com.  Feel free to suggest changes.

Personal notes:
---------------

1. Need to add <meta name=viewport content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> for previewing.
2. Need to make most links not follow _blank
3. Need to add twitter icon to each footer
4. Use lftp to upload files - helpful article https://community.c9.io/t/connecting-to-an-ftp-server-with-lftp/6694
